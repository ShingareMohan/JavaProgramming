data members

Default access modifier
-when we don't provide any access modifier then compiler provides default access modifier

-We can use all the access modifiers for variables and method

-For class declaration we can use default and public access modifiers

At which level we are using access modifiers => class level, variable level, and method level

default => class, variable, method
private => inner classes, variable, method
protected => inner classes, variable, method
public => class, variable, method
